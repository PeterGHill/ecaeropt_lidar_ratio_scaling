How to install
==============



Dependencies
------------

Because **ecaeropt** is a python program which uses calculation engines or backends in other languages, mainly in Fortran. Therefore it's needed:

- python3 (currently tested with python3.8 to python3.10) with libraries
  + numpy
  + toml
  + netcdf4
  + f2py3    (usually installed with numpy)

- nco  (it's used for comparing netcdf between versions)
- fortran 90 compiler


Installation
------------

If you have all the dependencies you only need to run **./build.sh**
